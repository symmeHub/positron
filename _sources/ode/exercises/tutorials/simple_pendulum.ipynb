This arm is articulated with respect to a frame considered as an inertial reference frame. The angle between the arm and the vertical direction is noted $\\theta$. A simple modeling using dynamics leads to :\n",

It is however possible to assume that $\\theta$ is small enough to write that $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$. In this case, the equation comes down to the one of a free and undamped harmonic oscillator treated in the theoretical part. The object of this tutorial is to solve this problem by a numerical approach in a general way without simplifying assumptions.\n"
