# Exercices

In this section, we propose quick exercises that can typically be done in an hour and a half.

* [](optim:tutorial:rosen) (duration: 1.5 h): introductory exercise that proposes to implement :
    * an optimization method to find the minimum of an analytical function (the rosenbrock function).
    * a curve fitting method 

Practical work

In this section, we propose longer exercises that can be done without assistance, typically in 4 hours.

* [](optim:tutorial:bridge) (duration: 4 h): In this session, we will modelled a bridge structure using truss and optimize it using various criteria.
