    "## Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the game of life?\n",
    "The game of life (**GoL**)is not a game per se. \n",
    "It is one of the first cellular automata. \n",
    "It can be visualized as a chessboard of arbitrary size in which each **cell** can exist in two states (dead=0 or alive=1). \n",
    "The game has an evolution rule that makes the state of its **cell** change with each time step.\n",
    "This rule is purely deterministic (which implies that there is no randomness in this game) and is based on the number of living [Moore neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) of each square. \n",
    "\n",
    "This rule can be written as follows:\n",
    "* Birth (**B**): if a dead cell has 3 neighbors, it becomes alive 1. It remains dead 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* Survival (**S**): If a living cell has 2 or 3 neighbors of Moore, it survives thus remains 1, it dies and becomes 0 otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rule of the game of life can be generalized as **B3/S23**. You can visualize the game graphically on the following simulator: https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/\n",

    "Our goal is to animate the game of life at a sufficient speed. Typically, a 200x200 grid should be able to be run in real time, i.e. 25 frames per second. \n",
    "The speed of your code execution must therefore be sufficient. \n",
    "Try counting Moore's living neighbors on a small grid at first before moving to a larger one.\n"
