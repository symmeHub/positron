    "\n",
    "This image is a micrograph of a high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel. \n",
    "The image was taken using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and shows the microstructure of the steel.\n",
    "The microstructure shows grains and separated by [grain boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_boundary). \n",
    "The grains are regions of the material where the atoms are arranged in a regular pattern.\n",
    "The grain boundaries are the interfaces between the grains.\n",
    "The size of the grains and the distribution of the grain boundaries are important for the mechanical properties of the material.\n",
    "For example, the [Hall-Petch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_boundary_strengthening) equation relates the yield strength of a material to the average grain size.\n",
