    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [Duffing oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffing_equation)  is a one-degree-of-freedom oscillator which, unlike a harmonic oscillator, has a non-linearity in its stiffness function. In its most general form, its differential equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot x + \\delta \\dot x + \\alpha x  +  \\beta x^3 = A \\sin (\\omega_d t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-linearity comes from the $\\beta x^3$ term. In this tutorial, we are going to work on a Duffing oscillator used in a practical purpose to recover vibratory energy in order to power autonomous communicating sensors. We are going to use the [PhD thesis of Thomas Huguet](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02061864) from the INSA Lyon and the University of Savoie Mont Blanc (defended in 2018).\n",
    "In the context of his article {cite:t}`huguet2019`, the choice of a Duffing oscillator is justified by its ability to efficiently recover energy over a broader frequency band than an equivalent harmonic oscillator. \n",
    "We will discuss some very interesting aspects of the Duffing oscillator, including: \n",
    "* Its ability to have several different solutions for the same excitation.\n",
    "* Its ability to respond chaotically in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Duffing oscillator that we will model is mechanically bistable, it is realized using the principle described on the diagram below (from  {cite:ps}`huguet2019`):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](huguet_model_design.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A beam with a mass in its center is compressed to buckling. \n",
    "It is then excited by means of a shaker which represents the vibrations present in the environment. \n",
    "An electrical extraction circuit is present but will not be modeled in this tutorial to simplify your task. \n",
    "The system has been manufactured and tested in the laboratory and is shown in the figure below (from  {cite:ps}`huguet2019`):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](huguet_experimental_setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential equation associated with this system is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot x + \\dfrac{\\omega_0^2}{2}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{x_{pit}^2} - 1\\right)x + \\dfrac{\\omega_0}{Q} \\dot x = -A_d \\sin \\omega_d t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* The position of the mass, its speed and acceleration are respectively noted $x$, $\\dot x$ and $\\ddot x$.\n",
    "* The stable equilibrium position, or pit,  is noted $\\pm x_{pit}$ (noted $x_0$ on the figure above).\n",
    "* The resonance frequency at the bottom of the pit is noted $omega_0$.\n",
    "* The quality factor is noted $Q$.\n",
    "* The excitation is defined by its amplitude $A_d$ and its pulsation $\\omega_d = 2 \\pi f_d$ where $f_d$ is its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In the configuration studied in the paper, an additional equation describes the behavior of the electrical energy extraction circuit. To simplify our task, it is not modeled in this example. You can add it if you wish, based on the article and by integrating the voltage $v$ to your vector $X$.\n",
