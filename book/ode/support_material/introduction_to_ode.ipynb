    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of solving differential equations is not just a mathematical concern. \n",
    "Many physical equations that describe the evolution and equilibrium of very diverse systems are differential equations. \n",
    "There are two types of differential equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ordinary Differential Equations** (ODE) in which the function being sought depends only on one variable, usually time $t$. \n",
    "* **Partial Differential Equations** in which it also depends on other variables, usually space. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we are only interested in ordinary differential equations.\n",
    "The notions discussed and the observations made are also largely applicable to partial differential equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This course is not a background paper on the underlying mathematical concepts. \n",
    "It is intended to provide the scientist with the necessary notions to make choices regarding the treatment of ODEs.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "An ODE can be described by several characteristics.\n",
    "In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Its order.\n",
    "* Its number of equations: depending on the problem, only one here but many ODEs can be presented as systems of equations.\n",
    "* The explicit time dependence. If this one does not appear, the equation is said to be autonomous. \n",
    "* Linearity: if the unknown function and its derivatives appear only multiplied by constants, then the equation is linear. \n",
    "On the contrary, for example if they appear to a power other than 1 or in a sine, then the equation is non-linear. \n",
    "Here the equation is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "::::{admonition} Example\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "As an example, we can consider the case of a free and undamped oscillator. \n",
    "Its motion is described by the following equation:\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: undamped_oscillator_ode\n",
    "\\ddot x + \\omega_0^2 x = 0\n",
    ":::\n",
    "The equation is linear of the second order. \n",

    "x(t) = a \\cos (\\omega_0 t)\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a \\in \\mathbb R^+$ is any constant. \n",
    "There is therefore an infinity of solutions. \n",
    "::::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on these characteristics, an equation will or will not have an exact known solution.\n",
    "Only a minority of them have such a solution. \n",
    "Although they are not the subject of this course, the exact solutions will serve as a reference to test the approximate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To address ODEs on a systematic basis, a generic formulation is usually used that takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: ode_generic\n",
    "\\dot X = f(X, t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $X: t \\mapsto X(t) = [X_0(t),\\dots, X_{N-1}(t)]^T $ is the unknown function.\n",
    "* $f$ is the ODE \n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation is both simple and surprising, it implies that all ODEs can be written as first order equations. \n",
    "Of course, this advantage has a price: the decrease of the order goes through an increase of the number of equations through the creation of intermediate functions. \n",

    "This reformulation is not just a mathematical trick. It also informs us about the physical nature of the problem being modeled. Indeed, the vector $X$ describes the state variables of the system. Thus, if $X$ and $t$ are known, the state of the system is fully determined. This has several essential consequences:\n",
    "* The solution of an ODE is related to the choice of **initial conditions** of $X$.\n",
    "* One can therefore plot the solutions of an equation in the $X$ space called **phase space**.\n",
    "* The ODE describes the evolution of $X$ at any point in phase space and at any time. By analogy, we can see $X$ as a position and $\\dot X = f(X, t)$ as the velocity of a particle in the phase space. The vector field defined by $f$ thus behaves like the velocity field associated with a fluid flow, so it is called the **vector flow**. \n",

    "* They are approximate, i.e. they imply a certain amount of error which must be made negligible depending on the problem being addressed. \n",

    "The graph above shows that the error levels and convergence rates of the 3 methods above are very different. We can first compare the forward Euler and RK4 methods. The latter evaluates the ODE 4 times per iteration and can therefore be considered as four times more complex. However, its error level is several orders of magnitude lower and its convergence rate is much better than forward Euler. Concerning odeint, we notice that this last algorithm has a much lower error level than Euler but a comparable convergence rate. In fact it uses an error control system which we will not detail here. However, we must remember that odeint is fast and reliable in many cases. \n"
