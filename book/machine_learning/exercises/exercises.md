# Exercices

In this section, we propose quick exercises that can typically be done in an hour and a half.:

* [](ML:tutorial:classification_demo) (duration: 1.5 h): iIntroductory exercise that will make you use a neural network modeled with PyTorch to classify points in supervised learning.




## Practical work

In this section, we propose longer exercises that can be done without assistance, typically in 4 hours.

* []() (duration: 4 h): todo
